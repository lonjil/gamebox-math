# gamebox-math

A high performance math library useful for making games.

## Overview

A library written in portable Common Lisp, providing support for common math
functions related to game development. Supported are 3-component vectors, 4x4
matrices, quaternions, and other high-level functions one may need when writing
a game.

## Install

``` lisp
(ql:quickload :gamebox-math)
```

## Usage

This library should be fairly self-explanatory to anyone familiar with linear algebra
and each symbol has a documentation string containing more detail.

The library follows a certain naming convention.
Functions having to do with vectors, points, lines, quaternions, dual quaternions,
and matrices are prefixed, respectively, with `vec-`, `point-`, `line-`, `quat-`,
`dquat-`, and `matrix-`. Some functions do not include the dash, notably addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and comparison functions. Each function has two variants,
one destructive and one consing. The destructing ones use `!` as a postfix.

Most functions also have an abbreviated name, these are mentioned in respective function's
documentation string.

Constructor functions for each of the above data types have the names listed above,
also without the dash. For example, `(vec)` produces a fresh vector.

Each of the above data types also have several ways of accessing their members.
Vecs, quats, and matrices can be accessed by index with the functions `vref`, `qref`,
and `mref`, respectively. Macros for locally binding members to symbols are available
under the names `with-X` where `X` is `vector`, `quat`, `dquat`, `matrix`,
or their plural forms. Example use:
```lisp
(with-vector (v my-vector)
  ; symbols vx, vy, and vz now available as accessors
)
(with-vectors ((v1 foo-vector)
               (v2 bar-vector)
               ...)
  ; symbol accessors for any number of vectors can now be used
)
```
Quats use x, y, z, w; matrices use 00 to 33; dquats are like quats except with r and d
added to the front of the member names, for the real and the dual part respectively.
